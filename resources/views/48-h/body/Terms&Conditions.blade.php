					<p> <strong>Terms & Conditions</strong></p>

<p>Legend :    4<sup>8</sup>-h = the site      </p>

<p>   If  you decide to participate, dealing or selling,  on the site, you have to register first, create an account and receive a usercode.  For the trust and transparancy, especially for the feedbacksystem, users are allowed to have only one account and one usercode. In the searchlistings and on the website only your usercode will be mentioned. Communicating between users, or with the site takes place under usercode. First when the deal is closed to be finished, on the final invoice your name,  emailaddress will appear. Addresses have to be confirmed before shipment/payment are completed.</p>

<p>Users bid  only for  their  account on  their behave.</p>

<p>Take note, a bid done in an ongoing auction cannot  be reversed, it is final. </p>

<p>Starting prices in an ongoing auction cannot be changed.</p>

<p>N.B. Items, opening  bidprices and descriptions from  auction search-listings, can be changed, or removed untill start of the auction.</p>

<p>As a buyer you only have to pay  the bidprice for what the item is purchased  plus the  correct postage for  shipment.  Air Mail, Registered Mail  and/or Track & Trace service are strongly  recommended  for shipments. It is the buyer who pays the costs for shipment. Because It is the buyer who decides the way and the costs of shipment  (and insurance), the buyer must be aware, for a shipment not-registered and without Track & Trace he automaticly accepts and takes over the responsibility for the shipment from that moment on. Seller has to inform the buyer  immediately after sending, about the Post-packetcode and Track & Trace number. Unfortunately  for some regions the regular postal service is not 100%, so in this case private postal couriers strongly recommended. Sending and receipt of the lodged shipment than are automaticly confirmated to  seller and buyer.                                              </p>

<p>The seller should never charge extras for the deal, so never ask more than the real costs of postage for the shipment.  The seller pays for  the  packaging, the buyer for the postage. The seller will always cooperate to send items as a combined shipment, to save costs.</p>

<p>The site expects buyers to pay the full sum of purchased item(s) incl. postage within 48 hours after the invoice is sent.</p>

<p>The site uses the USdollar as reserve currency.</p>

<p>Moderate and realistic startingbids garantee the fastest and most satisfactory deals. The site can give an almost 99,9% guarantee, all placed items in the auction will be sold.</p>

<p>New items are catagorized in a from the seller chosen new 4<sup>8</sup>-hours-folder.</p>

<p>Every day at  00.00h in London (Greenwich Mean Time) starts  a new 4<sup>8</sup>-hours-folder. Closing-time for every auction-folder will be 48 hours later, at midnight  24.00h GMT. Buyers are pointed out, when a bid is made, it is final, so  buyers should bid responsably.</p>

<p>Items in the auction not sold in the first auction-round, are automatic transfered in the next auctionround  (48 hrs.) with an opening bidprice of US$ 0,01.</p>

<p>Remind: Items cannot be whitdrawn during the auction.</p>

<p>Items should be well described and  catatologized conform the current catalogues ( for stamps Michel or Scott coins, banknotes Krause. Sellers can additionaly also mention another catalogue(number)</p>

<p>Buyers can apply for an alert-service for an item he seeks. The site will send  you  during 90 days  automatic an email-alert when this item is send in. After 90 days, you have to repeat your alert-application.</p>

<p>For  free use of the site users are urgently appealed to join our feedback-system, to build the reputations we all need.</p>

<p><strong>Feedback system.</strong>     </p>

<p>The site structures satisfaction with transparency. The feedbacksystem works with 5 stars. These stars  appears on the searchlisting next to the usercode, always be visable will be his average rating. With “clicking” on the usercode, the specified rating history will be made visable.</p>

<p>At the top, the average of all ratings, followed below the last 5 ratings being visable, expressing the ratings from the last 5 deals. All registered users can retrieve for other registered users the given ratings to date. The ratinghistory from all registered usercodes is completely callable and visable.  The auctionservice is free as long as users join our feedback-system. Users  who donot join our feedback-program will be asked to contribute a small amount of 1% of the transaction to help cover the costs of the website. In case a feedback was forgotten, the user will get  reminder with the next transaction, with the choice, the 1% contribution or still deliver the former rating.   Good usage of this feedback-system from both seller and buyer, is the backbone for the site.</p>

<p>Making reputations visable by sharing feedback from seller and buyer is the elixir that keeps this buy- and sell-system going in trust and honesty.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>

<p>The site  expects from the users, in case one party is not satisfied, always to contact the other party and ask for improvement or a resolution, before the feedback is given. When feedback Is given which the other party  does not agree, they should always contact the editor first with comments, questions and complaints. If the user still disagrees with this, contact can be made with the resolution center.</p>

<p>Items with hidden defects or repaired, should be described and declared precisely. Conterfeits, fakes or fraudulent copies are not allowed to appear  at the auction.  The site imposes  immediate suspension for interrogation. Depending on the facts, the site imposes up to the maximum penalty of termination of the membership . </p>

<p>Should a settlement in agreement not be possible, the site suggests  this to be expressed  in the feedback-rating, or in eventually to cancel a deal. In extreme cases, users can appeal the site-resolution-center (final and binding judgement for all parties).</p>

<p>In case a compromise  between seller and buyer is not possible , the option to rate the deal as negative for one, or both sides is open,  on the understanding that unjustified negative reviews can be challenged at the site-resolution-center, for what  the site-resolution-center will make a final and binding judgement. Unjustified negative ratings  will lead to a warning, so will repeated warnings lead to suspension.</p>

<p>Negative ratings if not repeated, will gradually optically disappear, but the entire overview of ratings will remain available.</p>
